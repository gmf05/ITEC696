    "Install [**Miniconda**](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) (preferred) or [**Anaconda**](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Anaconda comes with many packages already installed, while Miniconda is a more lightweight version allowing you to install only the packages you want. Here we prefer Miniconda since we'll soon install our own packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install packages we'll use the Python package manager **pip** (short for \"pip installs packages\"), which runs on the command line. We will use both Anaconda and pip via the command prompt. While the integrated development environment (IDE) [**Spyder**](https://pythonhosted.org/spyder) offers a way to install packages, using the command line will allow us more flexibility to manage **virtual environments**, self-contained versions of Python plus a set of packages. It also practices skills used in **remote computing**, i.e. doing computations on machines that are far away (often more powerful machines like desktops or supercomputing clusters).\n",

Virtual environments are useful for managing multiple projects and making it much easier to reproduce code across different machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a new virtual environment using Anaconda, open a terminal and run the following:\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "conda create -n itec696 python=3.6\n",
